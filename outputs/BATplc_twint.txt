1308700986538631168 2020-09-23 02:33:24 -0700 <BATplc> BAT is advocating for a collaborative, stakeholder-inclusive approach to accelerate tobacco harm reduction.  Our CMO Kingsley Wheaton's @GTNF2020 keynote highlights our #ABetterTomorrow purpose, driven by Innovation, Transformation and Sustainability.  https://t.co/pCDA9dYeTR  https://t.co/lTrxJo4uB2
1308674679440277506 2020-09-23 00:48:52 -0700 <BATplc> KW: So, let us come together and work hard. Let us collaborate together. Let us approach this complex problem together. Together we are stronger and together we will succeed
1308674375877644288 2020-09-23 00:47:39 -0700 <BATplc> #ABetterTomorrow is about TRANSFORMATION, it is about INNOVATION, and it is about SUSTAINABILITY. And, it is about PRIDE. A proud company, transforming and accelerating that transformation to create ‘A Better Tomorrow’.
1308674145245368322 2020-09-23 00:46:44 -0700 <BATplc> I believe BAT will stand proudly amongst the world’s foremost consumer products businesses. That is a vison that is shared by our people worldwide at BAT. That vision is what ‘A Better Tomorrow’ is about – it is, more than anything, our purpose.
1308673888247779328 2020-09-23 00:45:43 -0700 <BATplc> At BAT we have a vision. A vision of the BAT of 50 or even perhaps 100 years from now. How does that company look? What does it feel like? What will be its history?
1308673014553284609 2020-09-23 00:42:15 -0700 <BATplc> KW: I believe we have a very real opportunity for the company I am so proud of, to make a step-change that will benefit our stakeholders and enable consumers to choose the path of reduced risk, which they frequently tell us is so important to them.
1308672735149776898 2020-09-23 00:41:08 -0700 <BATplc> This 5-point framework is critical. Freedom to innovate, freedom to market, an evidence-based approach to policy formulation, all underpinned by science, with clear consumer communication interacting in a regulatory context where proportional regulation &amp; excise is evident. #GTNF
1308672262476836865 2020-09-23 00:39:15 -0700 <BATplc> KW: 5 key dimensions I say need to be included in contextual framework for the acceleration of tobacco harm reduction: •evidence-based approach  •proportionate regulation  •freedom to innovate  •engagement, dialogue &amp; communication •responsible marketing freedoms #GTNF
1308671704042999808 2020-09-23 00:37:02 -0700 <BATplc> KW: Some of the best product-related science can be found in our labs. So how can the very people generating the science, advocating for tobacco harm reduction &amp; who critically want a regulatory system that's fit for purpose, not have a voice, let alone a seat at the table? #GTNF
1308671451956948993 2020-09-23 00:36:02 -0700 <BATplc> KW: The greatest paradox of them all is the WHO, which believes that the ‘tobacco industry is not and cannot be a partner in effective tobacco control’, advocating for the tobacco industry to be excluded from any, and all, dialogue with government
1308671009541816321 2020-09-23 00:34:17 -0700 <BATplc> KW: There are 1.1 billion people who choose to consume tobacco and nicotine products. To exclude the manufacturers from the conversation is simply cutting off one’s nose to spite one’s face. #GTNF
1308670680444137472 2020-09-23 00:32:58 -0700 <BATplc> KW: Let’s find a better, more progressive way. A way that allows ALL key stakeholders to have a seat at the tobacco harm reduction table.  #GTNF
1308670173147262977 2020-09-23 00:30:57 -0700 <BATplc> KW: We continue to push for a more progressive, consistent approach to tobacco harm reduction policy.  Regulations that are founded in science, not opinion. Evidence trumping ideology, facts trumping beliefs. #GTNF
1308669927700783105 2020-09-23 00:29:59 -0700 <BATplc> KW: I am proud that we already have nearly 12 million regular users of our non-combustible products – an increase of 2.7 million consumers in just 12 months. And we aim to accelerate our adult consumer conversion. BAT is on the move and building significant momentum.  #GTNF
1308669305324810240 2020-09-23 00:27:30 -0700 <BATplc> KW: These include: Increasing our consumers of non-combustible products to 50 million by 2030; achieving carbon neutrality by 2030 and accelerating our previously set environmental targets to 2025. #GTNF
1308669167512453120 2020-09-23 00:26:58 -0700 <BATplc> KW: We recently announced a number of stretching targets that will accelerate our purpose to build #ABetterTomorrow and ensure best-in-class environmental, social and governance delivery. #GTNF
1308669005163569159 2020-09-23 00:26:19 -0700 <BATplc> KW: It is not enough to develop and sell new products.  Doing this in a sustainable and responsible way is fundamental to achieving #ABetterTomorrow which creates multi-stakeholder value. #GTNF
1308668500974751744 2020-09-23 00:24:19 -0700 <BATplc> KW: Innovation allows us to discover new ways to satisfy evolving consumer preferences while making tobacco harm reduction a reality. #GTNF
1308667767994880000 2020-09-23 00:21:24 -0700 <BATplc> KW: Understanding and responding to consumer needs is key. Our strategy, at BAT, puts the consumer right at the centre of our transformation. #GTNF
1308667594581442560 2020-09-23 00:20:43 -0700 <BATplc> KW: People often ask me ‘what does #ABetterTomorrow really mean?' For me, and put simply, it means focusing on Innovation; Transformation &amp; Sustainability. #GTNF

315068115937550339 2013-03-22 04:51:07 -0700 <BATplc> US Court: GHWs go beyond informing re dangers of smoking but are “unabashed attempts to evoke emotion and brow beat consumers into quitting”
315065983641456640 2013-03-22 04:42:38 -0700 <BATplc> US Federal Appeals Court says of GHWs: “such warnings are not effective at promoting cessation and discouraging initiation”
315063245327187968 2013-03-22 04:31:45 -0700 <BATplc> US Federal Appeals Court observed the FDA did not provide “a shred of evidence” showing that GHWs will reduce smoking rates
315058227366735872 2013-03-22 04:11:49 -0700 <BATplc> We agree packaging should have appropriate health warnings: bold, legible etc. But still no credible evidence that GHWs reduce smoking rates
315053643118305280 2013-03-22 03:53:36 -0700 <BATplc> US FDA decides not to appeal GHW case which it lost in Aug 2012. Common sense and need for evidence-based regulation prevails
