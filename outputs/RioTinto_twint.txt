1112981298870538241 2019-04-02 00:33:14 -0700 <RioTinto> Great to see the industry leadership in this area of sustainability by our partner @Nespresso.  We look forward to seeing the ASI in Chicago for the next stop in their US meetings with the industry.
1111033303459463168 2019-03-27 15:32:36 -0700 <RioTinto> Copper works pretty hard. It’s in the electrical wiring in your house and it’s leading the green revolution (think electric vehicles and wind turbines). But best of all, it’s the tiny antenna found in some hearing aids. And that sounds pretty good to us.
1109987877184630789 2019-03-24 18:18:27 -0700 <RioTinto> @BCG Thanks! Proud of our 47,500 employees who made it all possible

1108118978788900864 2019-03-19 14:32:07 -0700 <RioTinto> We love aluminium. And you should too. It’s strong, lightweight and corrosion-resistant – that’s why it’s used in bikes, cars, trains and planes.  So basically, aluminium helps you get around, but more importantly – it gets you home.  https://t.co/G3luia3eoF
1107416040940552193 2019-03-17 15:58:53 -0700 <RioTinto> “If you can find a faster, more efficient way to do any job – anywhere you go, great opportunities will come to you.” Yup. This is Khandarmaa – one of our six chosen to form the inaugural class of our #PioneerLab.  https://t.co/lvFY3yVeJA

1106335325251465216 2019-03-14 16:24:30 -0700 <RioTinto> Thrilled to open our new $2.6bn bauxite mine in far north Queensland last week. Amrun will provide jobs, business opportunities and growth for decades. Bauxite is processed into alumina then smelted into aluminium - one of the world’s most widely used metals.
1105460377926553603 2019-03-12 06:27:47 -0700 <RioTinto> We must care for our employees, respect and care for the communities and environment while we operate, and rehabilitate the land when we close. We’re delighted to release our 2018 Sustainability Report – visit our website to read more

1104867655939313664 2019-03-10 15:12:31 -0700 <RioTinto> Meet Ed, one of our pioneers on his way to our new #PioneerLab, “My grandad was an exploration geologist so I had a huge rock collection from age 6. I mean, I’ve always wanted to be at Rio Tinto, and it’s taken winding through various jobs, but in the end, I’m finally here.”  https://t.co/3Rg5AyIgwT

1102701896110755840 2019-03-04 14:46:33 -0700 <RioTinto> A lot of the stuff in modern life – from precious moments to everyday things – involves at least a little bit of the metals &amp; minerals we produce. In fact you’re probably looking at them, touching them or even wearing them right now. Without them, modern life just wouldn’t work.
1100879749868445696 2019-02-27 14:06:00 -0700 <RioTinto> In 2018, we declared the highest cash returns to shareholders in our history, delivered a reshaped &amp; improved portfolio, further strengthened our balance sheet &amp; invested in high-quality growth.

1098748902121984000 2019-02-21 16:58:46 -0700 <RioTinto> Could Rio Tinto's autonomous technologies be used in space? Whether it's drills breaking rocks on Mars, or rovers remotely navigating the rocky moonscape, for us, it's all about sharing our knowledge in mining to improve technology in space.
