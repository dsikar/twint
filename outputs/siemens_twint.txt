342262829652508673 2013-06-05 05:53:12 -0700 <Siemens> Regardless of the results of the upcoming federal elections, z next federal gvt. must make this a priority on its agenda. #FutureOfEnergy
342262608990179328 2013-06-05 05:52:19 -0700 <Siemens> P. Löscher: The initial orientation of the #energy transition about 2 years ago needs to be reviewed and revised. #FutureOfEnergy #Siemens
342262415699898368 2013-06-05 05:51:33 -0700 <Siemens> P. Löscher: We must change the current course and network the #energy transition #Europe-wide. #FutureOfEnergy
342262287626817536 2013-06-05 05:51:02 -0700 <Siemens> P. Löscher: At the moment, Europe’s energy policies are drifting apart. #FutureOfEnergy #Siemens
342262155271356417 2013-06-05 05:50:31 -0700 <Siemens> P. Löscher: Nor do we need an exclusively German energy transition – but rather one for all of Europe. #FutureOfEnergy #Siemens
342262041559584768 2013-06-05 05:50:04 -0700 <Siemens> #Siemens CEO Peter Löscher: We don’t need a Bavarian, Brandenburg or Berlin energy transition. #FutureOfEnergy
342261897929830400 2013-06-05 05:49:30 -0700 <Siemens> P. Löscher: In each case, #Siemens advances z required investment &amp; the city refinances this through their energy savings. #FutureOfEnergy
342261688336252928 2013-06-05 05:48:40 -0700 <Siemens> P. Löscher: In #Berlin #Siemens has carried out or is working on energy overhauls on around 200 public buildings.  #FutureOfEnergy
342261316133724160 2013-06-05 05:47:11 -0700 <Siemens> P. Löscher: Investments in energy efficiency initially sound like additional costs. But with smart financing models, much can be achieved.
342261101431517186 2013-06-05 05:46:20 -0700 <Siemens> P. Löscher: In order to reduce our consumption, we need more regulatory pressure. #FutureOfEnergy #Siemens
342260911786041345 2013-06-05 05:45:34 -0700 <Siemens> P.Löscher: #Siemens therefore advocates a speedy implementation of the European Energy Efficiency Directive in #Germany. #FutureOfEnergy

342259883841839105 2013-06-05 05:41:29 -0700 <Siemens> #Siemens has a proposal as to how we can achieve the energy transition at a far lower price. #FutureOfEnergy
342259745962467328 2013-06-05 05:40:56 -0700 <Siemens> P. Löscher: The climate target can be reached by 2030 with fewer renewables at far lower costs! #FutureOfEnergy #Siemens
342259619575500801 2013-06-05 05:40:26 -0700 <Siemens> P. Löscher: We should exclusively concentrate on one climate target and desist from unchecked expansion of renewables. #FutureOfEnergy
342259491569537026 2013-06-05 05:39:56 -0700 <Siemens> P. Löscher: To get these contradictions under control, #Siemens proposes a Three-Point Plan. #FutureOfEnergy
342259285415305216 2013-06-05 05:39:07 -0700 <Siemens> P. Löscher: Because coal-fired power plants have to compensate for the fluctuations of the renewable sources. #FutureOfEnergy #Siemens
342259170457812992 2013-06-05 05:38:39 -0700 <Siemens> P. Löscher: And yet we are getting no closer to reaching our goal of reducing CO2 emissions. #FutureOfEnergy #Siemens
