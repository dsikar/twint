1178659771353690114 2019-09-30 06:16:02 -0700 <AstraZeneca> When diagnosed at an early stage the 5-year survival rate for #prostatecancer is nearly 100%. However, for men with metastatic prostate cancer (spread to other parts of the body) the 5-year survival rate drops to only 30%, underlining the importance of earlier diagnosis. #ESMO19  https://t.co/td7kpEtEFg

1178587548190298112 2019-09-30 01:29:03 -0700 <AstraZeneca> When cells have defects in their #DDR pathways, mutations can accumulate and make the cell cancerous. This also makes them vulnerable to #DNA damage and more dependent on other repair pathways. This dependency can be exploited as it differentiates #cancer cells from normal cells.  https://t.co/4u2unHcKNr
