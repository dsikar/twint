If so, consol IO may not be better than waiting until relapse to go IO to those who need it, when they need it, sparing those already cured w/chemoRT. But we need to manage pts based on data we have now.

If durva x1 yr doesn't incr 5-yr OS, consol IO is just pre-emptive Rx for met dzs, arguable over-treatmt, &amp; shld be reconsidered, IMO
964998243951063046 2018-02-17 15:01:24 -0700 <JackWestMD> @notahedge @DrewMoghanaki @n8pennell @JFreemanDaily @AstraZeneca @rschilsky @CliffordHudis @wallyjc @dhjutsw1 @XRT4U @drdavidpalma @ASCOPres Agree. If IO just delays relapse &amp; pts do just as well w/rescue, &amp; it would save need for 20% of already cured pts from getting tox (&amp; incurring cost) of durvalumab x 1 yr, IO for all as consolidation may be no benefit. But we must weigh risk/benefit based on data today. #LCSM

But we also need to weigh potential harm of denying IO x yrs for 1000s of pts w/stage III NSCLC now. IMO, more likely to harm by not accepting huge odds OS better. #LCSM
964945182926909440 2018-02-17 11:30:34 -0700 <JackWestMD> @DrewMoghanaki @n8pennell @JFreemanDaily @AstraZeneca @rschilsky @CliffordHudis @wallyjc @dhjutsw1 @XRT4U @drdavidpalma @ASCOPres Fair, but we rightly had equipoise about this trial, which could not have answered Q as well w/o placebo control. There are other trials that showed superiority of placebo arm over intervention. In both cases, care for many thousands of future pts was improved based on results.

That must be why we don't favor EGFR inhibitors 1st line systemic therapy of choice for EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC. Oh, wait...

PFS may be statistically significant but still not be that impressive. Here, PFS is REMARKABLY greater, sustained at 18 mo, &amp; accompanied by signif diff in time to new mets or death. It is clinically significant &amp; new SOC whether you agree or not.
