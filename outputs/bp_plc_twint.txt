We're introducing a new organization, a new leadership team &amp; new ways of working to help us work towards our new aim
1227678018753191936 2020-02-12 11:37:03 -0700 <bp_plc> @DrSimEvans A - we want to share what we're doing &amp; make sure it's as clear as possible 🙂
1227675954627174400 2020-02-12 11:28:51 -0700 <bp_plc> Earlier today our CEO Bernard Looney announced BP's bold new purpose and ambition #bpNetZero. If you missed it, here are some of the highlights:
1227674115408113664 2020-02-12 11:21:32 -0700 <bp_plc> @xrwsm We want to help the world get to net zero too; the whole energy system needs to be transformed, and everyone has a part to play---producers and sellers of energy, users of energy and policy-makers 2/2

1227666546375434241 2020-02-12 10:51:28 -0700 <bp_plc> @jmagreen @ottermarie Hi Juan, our new ambition tackles Scope 3 head on. We're not just aiming to halve the carbon intensity of our products - as others seek to do. We're aiming for net zero on an absolute basis for the carbon associated with the oil &amp; gas we dig out of the ground #bpNetZero

1227622696093200390 2020-02-12 07:57:13 -0700 <bp_plc> @SonyKapoor Our Scope 3 aim is getting to net zero for the carbon in our oil &amp; gas production by 2050 or sooner. We see this as the main Scope 3 challenge for our sector. In addition we're aiming to help people reduce their emissions by cutting the carbon intensity of what we sell by 50% 2/2
1227622677797572614 2020-02-12 07:57:09 -0700 <bp_plc> @SonyKapoor Oil &amp; gas will still be needed by the middle of the century &amp; beyond but it needs to change &amp; to decarbonize. That’s why we're aiming to be net zero across our operations &amp; our oil &amp; gas production by 2050 or sooner. The changes we're making to the biz reflect our seriousness 1/2
1227622432812433409 2020-02-12 07:56:10 -0700 <bp_plc> @ktkinnear It will be up on  https://t.co/URv7ldMICE later today. Thanks!
1227622184618807303 2020-02-12 07:55:11 -0700 <bp_plc> @duartej Increasing the proportion of investment into our non-oil &amp; gas business is one of our aims. We’re not going to commit to an arbitrary or pre-set number. But make no mistake, we expect to invest more &amp; more in low carbon businesses over time – &amp; invest less in oil &amp; gas over time
1227621245270790146 2020-02-12 07:51:27 -0700 <bp_plc> @TheGarrard We know the pace &amp; direction of travel we're setting out will be insufficient for some people.

1227621107899019264 2020-02-12 07:50:54 -0700 <bp_plc> @patrickgaley Taken together, Aim 1 &amp; 2 cover around 415 million tonnes of emissions – 55 million from our operations (Aim 1) &amp; 360 million from the carbon in our upstream production (Aim 2)

1149233383207313408 2019-07-11 01:26:04 -0700 <bp_plc> It’s a world where people and businesses will have moved away from a throw-away culture and are embracing the circular economy…Where we harness nature’s power to reduce emissions – through planting trees and nurturing peatlands
1149233382133510144 2019-07-11 01:26:04 -0700 <bp_plc> Streets humming with electric and hydrogen-powered cars and the skies and seas being navigated by planes and ships powered by biofuels and hydrogen
1149233380866908160 2019-07-11 01:26:04 -0700 <bp_plc> Here’s one more area where there’s a high level of agreement - the necessary components for a net-zero world: Zero-carbon power keeping us warm &amp; the lights on…provided largely by renewables &amp; supported by decarbonized gas including the use of carbon capture use &amp; storage (CCUS)
1149233379562463238 2019-07-11 01:26:04 -0700 <bp_plc> BP also agrees with its critics on the need for the world to move to net zero emissions. BP applauds the UK government’s ambition to reach net zero even sooner, by mid-century
1149233378090242048 2019-07-11 01:26:03 -0700 <bp_plc> If dithering &amp; delay today lead to an abrupt, precipitous course-correction tomorrow, that could be highly disruptive for business &amp; the world economy. So, we need to get on with it
1149233376936845312 2019-07-11 01:26:03 -0700 <bp_plc> Like our critics, BP believes the world is not on a sustainable path. Like our critics, we also support a rapid transition to a lower carbon future

1146432129317986304 2019-07-03 07:54:53 -0700 <bp_plc> @hughmainwaring The main consensus in the industry currently is that V2G is not likely to be significant in the near term, this reflects both the need for greater infrastructure and current costs, particularly in terms of battery degradation if batteries are discharged and recharged far more -

De problemen zijn een direct gevolg van de lage waterstand van de rivier de Rijn door de al lang aanhoudende droogte.
1090533812168097793 2019-01-30 00:54:56 -0700 <bp_plc> Hi @Keynko we are really sorry about this. Can you send an image of the full receipt to careline@bp.com using reference 1-7400085115 and we can look into this further.  Thanks, Anna
1090324866010697728 2019-01-29 11:04:39 -0700 <bp_plc> @RBrulle Our near-term plan will see us allocate at least $500m a year to develop low carbon businesses &amp; nurture low carbon technology &amp; we are prepared to spend more as we see options that are scalable
1090324758971985920 2019-01-29 11:04:14 -0700 <bp_plc> @RBrulle So while creating lower carbon businesses is important, we also need to produce all types of energy more efficiently. That means making them cleaner, better &amp; lower carbon. We are working hard on doing that across the whole business – upstream &amp; downstream. 2/3
1090324645071503360 2019-01-29 11:03:47 -0700 <bp_plc> @RBrulle We do have a strong and growing renewables business, including solar, wind &amp; biofuels, but meeting the Paris goals is not a race to renewables - it’s a race to lower emissions. 1/3
1090260447196983299 2019-01-29 06:48:41 -0700 <bp_plc> @tomkiss For example, we see possibilities in natural gas, the smart partner to renewables that burns 50% cleaner than coal in power generation. Visit  https://t.co/BvC4BGbdBR for more information
1090260334852501505 2019-01-29 06:48:14 -0700 <bp_plc> @tomkiss Hi Tom, renewables are important – but only part of the story. Other sources of energy (like oil &amp; gas) will be necessary to meet growing global demand. What we’re doing is looking to make energy cleaner, better &amp; lower carbon. 1/2

1041701960510926849 2018-09-17 07:54:35 -0700 <bp_plc> @Jason_Smizzle (2/2) we urge consumers to report evidence of suspected price gouging at any local retail sites to the office of your state’s attorney general. Also, we have been seeing reports of an inaccurate price on a photo that was caused from an error on sign display.
1041701321466732546 2018-09-17 07:52:03 -0700 <bp_plc> @Jason_Smizzle (1/2) Retail gasoline prices are not set by BP.  They are a reflection of the current function of supply and demand and are ultimately set by the individual retail sites, which are independently owned and operated. Consumers should not tolerate price gouging.
