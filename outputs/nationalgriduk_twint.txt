828691074667409409 2017-02-06 11:45:23 -0700 <nationalgriduk> A diesel filling station needs tankers to refill it. A CNG station doesn't, so has a really low carbon footprint.  https://t.co/2U3nPA9rSz
828690954697707520 2017-02-06 11:44:54 -0700 <nationalgriduk> We believe using more CNG will help to reduce CO2 emissions and improve the quality of air we breathe.  https://t.co/Nc0Z0wGX2K #theoneshow
828690658831585280 2017-02-06 11:43:44 -0700 <nationalgriduk> While diesel currently dominates, natural gas is a cheaper, greener and quieter option.  https://t.co/EcsMLzhv4V #theoneshow #cng #co2
